## ABSTRACT

[[kyoto_uni/MQTT|MQTT]] security. 

Transition from MQTT 3.1.1 â†’ MQTT 5.0 introduced enhanced authentication mechanisms that remain underexplored.

Recent research demonstrates active work in machine Learning-based intrusion detection, blockchain integration, and federated learning approaches.

Use ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi devices to test out connection capabilities.

MQTT prioritizes simplicity over security by design. Many MQTT brokers have been detected using default configurations, with 98% of IoT device traffic remaining unencrypted (Palo Alto Networks studies). 

## MQTT vulnerabilities

### Authentication and authorization weaknesses
