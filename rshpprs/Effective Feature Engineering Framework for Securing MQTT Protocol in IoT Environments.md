#MQTT #security #ML

Aims to construct and imporve the MQTT protocol's IDS efficiency by employing feature selection algorithms and then utilizing ML models to detect attacks on IoT devices.

ML models used in this study: RF, DT, KNN, AdaBoost, and XGBoost

## Takeaway

Featuer selection can lead to more effective and efficient cyber-attack classification systems for MQTT traffic.

Resulted in valuable advantages such as an improved model to get faster training and teting times, enhanced accuracy, reduced dimensionality of the feature set, decreased impact of external factors, and optimization of storage and processing resources.

It is possible to detect cyber-attacks on MQTT traffic effectively. Among these models, RF showed the highest accuracy, followed by DT and AdaBoost. 

This paper outperformed other studies in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
