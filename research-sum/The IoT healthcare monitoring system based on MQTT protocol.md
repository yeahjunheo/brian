recommends a real-time remote patient monitoring system based on IoT to assuer the accuracy of the vital RT signal

healthcare IoT
- identity technology
	- authorized org gets distinct identy as part of identification process (transparent data sharing)
	- globally unique vs universally unique
	- Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) universally unique identity can be used without centralized coordination.
	- sensors and actuators in healthcare networks are recognized and addressed independently
	- IoT-based technology improvements, a distinctive identity may change during the IoT system's life cycle.
	- system to update this information (changing setting could impact tracking and diagnosis of network device)
- communication technology
	- broadly categorized into medium-range and short-range communication technologies.
	- medium-range supports commnuication over long distances (base station and central node of a body area network)
	- short-range (protocols used to connect objects within a constrained range or a BAN)
		- range from a few mm to several meters
			-Bluetooth, RFID, wifi, Zigbee
	- Zigbee? mesh topology but much like bluetooth.
		- low power feating
		- fast transmission rates
		- extensive capacity network
	- 
- location technology
